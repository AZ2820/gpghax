# Uninstalling gpghax.

* Format an USB drive to FAT32 with a label SONY
* Download this repository and put all the files in the root folder of the USB drive.
* If you use Japanese/Taiwan/Hong Kong model of the console, you will have to remove the `databases/default.db` file and rename the `databases/default_jp.db` to `databases/default.db`, otherwise you will end up with non-working US games on your JP system.
* Turn off the PlayStation Classic
* Plug the USB drive into the PlayStation Classic
* Turn on the console
* After few seconds the power LED should start blinking and the TV should go black.
* Remove the power cable from the console.
* Remove the USB drive from the console.
* Insert power cable into the console.
* Start the console again, if everything went right, you should have restored the console to the factory state, retaining all the save files.
* If above didn't work, open a new issue and attach the `uninstall.log` and `filelist.log` from the root folder of the USB drive.
* If it did, congratulations! Now, format the USB drive again, go to https://github.com/pathartl/BleemSync and use that. It's much safer and easier way of injecting custom games that actually works.
